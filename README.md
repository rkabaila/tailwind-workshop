1. Adding Base Styles. Make body background gray and all h1's font-size 1.5 rem, h2's font-size 1.25 rem. Add container with margin left and right 2rem. Add centered h1 - Couriers page and h2 - Couriers list.

2. Add Proxima Nova font to project(https://en.bestfonts.pro/font/proxima-nova). Apply Proxima Nova regular to whole project and semibold to h1. You can check font using Chrome extension WhatFont. Need to rerun yarn start after modifying tailwind.css or tailwind.config.js file.

3. Add headings to the list:
   Id
   Firstname
   Lastname
   Vehicle
   Service centre
   Circuit
   Status.
   Add some couriers data :
   const couriers = [
   {
   id: "1",
   firstName: "John",
   lastName: "Doe",
   serviceCentre: "ABERDEEN",
   vehicle: "Bike",
   status: "busy",
   circuit: "On circuit",
   },
   {
   id: "2",
   firstName: "John",
   lastName: "Doe",
   serviceCentre: "ABERDEEN",
   vehicle: "Bike",
   status: "busy",
   circuit: "On circuit",
   },
   {
   id: "3",
   firstName: "John",
   lastName: "Doe",
   serviceCentre: "ABERDEEN",
   vehicle: "Bike",
   status: "busy",
   circuit: "On circuit",
   },
   ]
   Make each cell width w-1/7.

   As tailwind does not have this class, add it to tailwind config.
   If the className becomes too long or we want to reuse it we can:

   - move it to a css class to tailwind.css file - make listHeader class in tailwind.css and apply some styles like flex flex-row bg-gray-400
   - move it to constant above - make .headerCell const with some styles like py-2 px-5 w-1/7 font-bold
   - make a component - make a Cell component which render h3 with some classes like py-2 px-5 w-1/7. When we make component, we have to pass className prop to component, that additional classes would work on it.
   - ...
   - ...
     What are you using?

4. Make list responsive: display 3 columns on mobile, 4 on sm, 5 on md, 6 on lg, 7 on xl.

5. Theme colors are defined in /tailwindcss/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js. If we need more colors, we extend theme in tailwind.config.js. Add color silver #C0C0C0 to theme and use it for header bar background.

6. Add base styles using plugin. You should prefer a plugin if:
   You want to publish your base styles publicly and make them easy for other users to install.
   You want to re-use your base styles across multiple projects in your company and prefer sharing JS dependencies instead of CSS dependencies.
   Add h3 above the list with base styles like { margin: "30px 0", textAlign: "right" } saying "Filters"

7. Components using plugins. In addition to writing component classes directly in your CSS files, you can also add component classes to Tailwind by writing your own plugin. Add components :
   const buttons = {
   ".btn": {
   padding: ".5rem 1rem",
   borderRadius: ".25rem",
   fontWeight: "600",
   },
   ".btn-blue": {
   backgroundColor: "#3490dc",
   color: "#fff",
   "&:hover": {
   backgroundColor: "#2779bd",
   },
   },
   ".btn-red": {
   backgroundColor: "#e3342f",
   color: "#fff",
   "&:hover": {
   backgroundColor: "#cc1f1a",
   },
   },
   };
   and use .btn .btn-blue for button "Load more" below the list.

8. Make spinner and show it on Load more click.

9. Prepare production build. In tailwind config add purge and include all files which uses tailwind css classes.

10. Override third party library css. Use react select for courier filters.
